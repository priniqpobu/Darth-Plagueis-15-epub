The chapter begins with Sidious meeting with his allies in the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guild, and the Banking Clan, who are preparing to launch a blockade of Naboo, Sidious' homeworld. Sidious assures them that he has everything under control, and that they will soon have a new Supreme Chancellor who will support their interests. He then contacts his other ally, Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master who has secretly joined the Sith. Sidious tells Dooku that he has found a new apprentice, a young Jedi named Maul, who will serve as his enforcer. He also reveals that he has discovered the identity of the Chosen One, a boy named Anakin Skywalker, who lives on Tatooine. Sidious orders Dooku to find and kill Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker, to prevent any interference from the Jedi.
     
Meanwhile, Plagueis is attending a gala on Coruscant, where he is posing as a wealthy and influential businessman named Hego Damask. He is unaware that Sidious has orchestrated an assassination attempt on him, using a group of mercenaries hired by one of his rivals. Plagueis senses the danger and manages to escape with his loyal bodyguard, 11-4D. He contacts Sidious and tells him that he knows about his treachery. He also reveals that he has been experimenting with the Force, and that he has succeeded in creating life from midi-chlorians, the microscopic organisms that connect living beings to the Force. He claims that he has created Anakin Skywalker, and that he is the true father of the Chosen One.
     
Sidious is shocked and enraged by this revelation. He decides to confront Plagueis in person and finish him off once and for all. He arrives at Plagueis' penthouse suite, where he finds him meditating in his sleep chamber. Sidious unleashes a barrage of Force lightning on Plagueis, who tries to resist with his own power. The two Sith Lords engage in a fierce duel of wills, as they try to bend the Force to their will. Sidious taunts Plagueis for being weak and foolish, while Plagueis accuses Sidious of being arrogant and reckless. Sidious tells Plagueis that he has no need for him anymore, and that he will rule the galaxy with his new apprentice, Maul. He also says that he will find Anakin Skywalker and turn him to the dark side, or kill him if he resists.
     
Plagueis refuses to give up, and tries to use his mastery of midi-chlorians to heal himself and counter Sidious' attacks. He also tries to reach out to Anakin through the Force, hoping to influence him to follow his path. However, Sidious proves to be too strong for him, and eventually overpowers him with his lightning. Plagueis falls to the floor, gasping for breath. Sidious stands over him triumphantly, and delivers the final blow with his lightsaber. He then declares himself as Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith, and proclaims that he has brought an end to the Rule of Two, which stated that there can only be two Sith at a time: a master and an apprentice. He says that from now on, there will be only one Sith: himself.
     
The chapter ends with Sidious sensing a disturbance in the Force, as if something has shifted in his favor. He realizes that it is a sign that his plan has succeeded, and that he has become the undisputed master of the dark side. He smiles wickedly, and prepares to execute the next phase of his scheme: the invasion of Naboo, and the rise of his puppet, Senator Palpatine, to the office of Supreme Chancellor.
